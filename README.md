# Computer-Vision ECE 5554 Virginia Tech
Computer Vision ECE 5554 Course contents and other cool stuff I tried.

Course Taught by Prof. Dr. Jia Bin Huang


Hybrid Images - Create a hybrid image using a low pass and a band pass filtered image overlaid on top of each other. It creates an illusion wherein one image is seen from distance and as you see it from a closer view point, the other image is seen.

Gaussian and Laplacian Pyramids - Generated multilevel gaussian and laplacian pyramids. 

Edge Detection - Canny edge detection. Also performed edge detection using multiple oriented filters which improved the accuracy of the edges.

Kanade Lucas Tomasi Tracker - Performed feature selection and tracked those features over 50 frames using the KLT tracker.

Shape Alignment - Used a global affine transform to perform shape alignment on set of images.

SIFT Feature Matching - Used a set of SIFT features to track a particular object in another image.

Fundamental Matrix - Used Epipolar Geometry constraints along with feature matching to detect epipolar lines.

Structure from Motion -  Using tracked features, generated structure from a set of images in motion. generated the camera rotation and translation path.
